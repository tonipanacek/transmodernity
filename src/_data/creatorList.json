    "name": "Lula DAHRINGER",
    "role": "Lula is a Berlin-born and Barcelona-based film directress, writer and creative producer. She loves doing, what she does. Telling fringe stories through moving image and written word to help process and contextualize this mad but magical world. Driven by social change, her work explores ancient and current societal, political and personal narratives. Interconnectivity is plausible to her. Popular politics appal her. Inaction is not an option for her. In 2012 she graduated from London College of Communication (University of Arts London) with a BA in Journalism. The choice of degree stemmed from her love for writing and the desire to draw attention to topics that often remain underrepresented. She is currently studying at Escuela Superior de Cinema i Audiovisuals de Catalunya (ESCAC) a for a MA in Film Direction.",
