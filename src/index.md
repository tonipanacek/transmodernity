2019 / 92 minutes

TRANSMODERNITY is a documentary about changemakers that challenge and transform the current system by exploring new possibilities for transitioning into a new paradigm with alternative social, economic and cultural approaches. Transmodernity is the new now.

It raises the question of how reality can be possible in a different way. It is a portrait of our time and its currents, created by a mosaic of twelve different changemakers and their projects across Europe. The film touches upon the need to reinvestigate our education, consumption, relation to ourself and much more. Told through the eyes of activists, artists, educators, entrepreneurs, and social workers who are paving the way for the old system to be transformed by doing what they truly believe in, the film calls for a shared vision of a fundamental socio-cultural change, as well as an exploration meaning and value today. The film aims to be an inspiration and appeal for all of us to take responsibility, dream and act upon it.
