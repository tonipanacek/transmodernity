Let’s collaborate!

Host a screening for your community: your school, university, co-living project, co-working space, eco village, conference, festival -- or wherever else you’d like to share the film.

How?

Buy the film here (links to: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/transmodernity) and show it.
Get in touch with us! (links to: connect@transmodernity.org)
We can send you info material on how to host a screening for educative purposes or elsewhere
We can also help you to promote your event and are happy to participate in (virtual) Q&A sessions worldwide.

We want the film to inspire as many people as possible, so we thank you in advance for wanting to spread the love ❤︎
