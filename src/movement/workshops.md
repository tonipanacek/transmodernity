We are happy to share a workshop that will leave you inspired. Due to the high diversity of topics that we told through the eyes of activists, artists, educators, entrepreneurs & social workers in the film, we can design a workshop specifically for your intended purpose: education, ecology,  economy, new work, art as therapy, creativity and spirituality. Whatever you feel is needed to be brought to attention, we engage the participants to get in touch with the side of them, that wants to take change now. We can help you promote your event.
